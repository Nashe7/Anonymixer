## How Anonymixer Bitcoin Mixer Service Works

Anonymixer leverages multiple privacy techniques to obscure transaction flows:

   The deposited Bitcoin is split into smaller pieces and mixed with coins from other users to prevent linkage.

3. **Randomized Mixing Routes**  
   The fragmented coins follow randomized routing paths to prevent pattern recognition by blockchain analysis tools.
